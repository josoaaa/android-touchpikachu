Just a generic clicker app for Androidâ€¦ but with a Pikachu!

I created this app to count laps during my workouts. Instead of using a classic clicker, which sometimes recorded accidental laps, I developed a custom one. After completing a lap, I tap the Pikachu icon to mark it. I implemented a 5-second interval between taps to ensure accurate counting without errors.
